# gchart

GChart is a very simple library that allows you to easily create arrays that are compatible with the Google Charts library. I use it together with Laravel and I am too much of a noob to explain you how to use it otherwise.

## Installation

Put this in composer.json

```
require: "grumpydictator/gchart": "dev-master"
```

Update the providers-array in app/config/app.php  with this:

```php
'Grumpydictator\Gchart\GchartServiceProvider',
```

## Examples

```php
// coming soon!
```
